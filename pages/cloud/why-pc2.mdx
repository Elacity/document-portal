# Why Self-Host?

**Stop renting your digital life. Start owning it.**

## The Problem

Every file you upload, every calculation you run, every AI conversation you have—it all lives on someone else's server. You're paying rent for your own digital life. You're trusting strangers with your most private data.

### The Reality Today

- **Your photos?** Stored on Google's servers. They scan them. They use them to train AI.
- **Your documents?** On Dropbox. They can read them. They can lock you out.
- **Your AI chats?** On OpenAI's servers. They're training models on your private thoughts.
- **Your calculations?** Running on AWS. Every number is tracked.

**You're not a customer. You're the product.**

## The Solution: Digital Sovereignty

What if you could run your entire digital life on **your own hardware**?

Not a VPS you rent. Not a cloud service you subscribe to. **Your actual computer.** Your Raspberry Pi. Your old Mac. Your server in your basement.

**With PC2, you can:**
- Store your files where **you** control the keys
- Run calculations on **your** hardware, where no one can see them
- Chat with AI where **your** conversations never leave your property
- Own your identity with **your** wallet, not someone's email database

## Privacy Comparison

| Aspect | Cloud Services | PC2 |
|--------|---------------|-----|
| **File Scanning** | Yes, for "safety" and ads | No scanning possible |
| **AI Training** | Your data trains their models | Your data stays local |
| **Account Lock** | Can happen anytime | Impossible—you hold the keys |
| **Government Access** | Subject to subpoenas | Your hardware, your jurisdiction |
| **Data Location** | Unknown data centers | Your physical location |

## The Wallet-Based Identity

Traditional cloud services use email and password:
- Passwords can be forgotten, hacked, or reset by support
- Email accounts can be compromised
- You don't truly "own" your account

PC2 uses your blockchain wallet:
- Your private key = your identity
- No password to forget or hack
- No "account recovery" that bypasses you
- True cryptographic ownership

## The WASM Advantage

When you run a calculation on Google Sheets, it happens on Google's servers. They see your numbers. They log your formulas.

When you run a calculation on PC2:
- The WASM binary executes on **your node**
- Your data never leaves your hardware
- No logging, no surveillance, complete privacy

**This is the difference between using someone else's computer and using your own.**

## Who Is PC2 For?

### Privacy-Conscious Individuals
Keep personal files, photos, and documents truly private.

### Developers
Run your own infrastructure. Deploy custom WASM applications. Full control.

### Small Businesses
Avoid vendor lock-in. Own your data. Reduce long-term costs.

### Crypto Natives
Wallet-based identity. Self-custody mentality extended to your entire digital life.

## The Bottom Line

> "Every other cloud service asks you to trust them. PC2 asks you to trust yourself."

Your hardware. Your data. Your computation. Your sovereignty.
