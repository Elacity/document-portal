### Sign Authentication Message

You'll be asked to sign a message to prove ownership. This is free (no gas).

### Setup Wizard (First Time Only)

On first login, you'll see:
1. **Welcome** — Introduction to PC2

## Setup Wizard Details

### Username Selection

- Must be 3-20 characters
- Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only
- Cannot start/end with hyphen
- Must be unique (availability checked in real-time)

Your username becomes: `yourname.ela.city`

### Recovery Phrase

<Callout type="warning">
**Critical**: Write down your 12-word recovery phrase and store it safely. This is the ONLY way to recover your node identity if you lose access.
</Callout>

The recovery phrase:
- Generates your node's Ed25519 keypair
- Creates your DID (Decentralized Identifier)
- Can restore your identity on a new device

Click "Copy to Clipboard" and save somewhere secure.

- Survives page refreshes
- Works across tabs
- Stored in browser cookie

## Multiple Devices

You can access your PC2 node from multiple devices:
1. Open the same URL on another device
2. Connect with the same wallet
3. Sign authentication message

## Troubleshooting
