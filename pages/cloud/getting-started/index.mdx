## Quick Start (Local — Fastest Way to Try)

The fastest way to try PC2:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Elacity/pc2.net/main/scripts/start-local.sh | bash
```

This automatically:
- Installs Node.js (if needed)
- Installs PM2 process manager
- Downloads and builds PC2
- Starts the server

Then open **http://localhost:4200** and connect your wallet!

<Callout type="info">
Works on **macOS**, **Linux**, and **Windows** (via WSL2).
</Callout>

## What Happens Next

1. **Connect Wallet** — MetaMask, Essentials, or any WalletConnect wallet
2. **Desktop Loads** — Full cloud desktop in your browser
3. **Start Using** — Upload files, run apps, chat with AI

## Verify Installation

After starting, check these work:

- Desktop loads in browser at http://localhost:4200
- Can connect wallet and login
- Can upload and download files
- Calculator app opens and works (proves WASM works)

## Managing Your Node

After installation, use these commands:

```bash
pm2 status          # Check if running
pm2 logs pc2        # View logs
pm2 stop pc2        # Stop server
pm2 start pc2       # Start server
pm2 restart pc2     # Restart server
```

## Get a Public URL

Want to access your node from anywhere?

### Option A: Free *.ela.city Subdomain (Recommended)

Register for instant HTTPS - your node gets a public URL like `yourname.ela.city`:

1. Go to Settings → Network in your PC2 dashboard
2. Register your subdomain
3. Access from anywhere!

### Option B: Custom Domain

See [VPS Deployment](/cloud/getting-started/vps#custom-domain) for Caddy/Nginx setup.
