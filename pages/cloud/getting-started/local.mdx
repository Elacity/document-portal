# Local Install

Run PC2 on your own computer. Choose your preferred method:

## Option 1: Desktop Launcher (Mac & Linux)

Download the **ElastOS Desktop Launcher** for a visual interface:

| Platform | Download |
|----------|----------|
| **macOS** | [Download .dmg](https://github.com/Elacity/elastos-launcher/releases/latest) |
| **Linux** | [Download .AppImage](https://github.com/Elacity/elastos-launcher/releases/latest) |

The launcher provides one-click Start/Stop, status monitoring, and log viewing.

<Callout type="warning">
**Windows users:** Local installation is complex. We recommend using a [VPS](/cloud/getting-started/vps) instead. See the Windows section below for details.
</Callout>

### Mac Installation (One-Time Setup)

macOS shows a security warning for apps downloaded outside the App Store. Follow these steps once:

1. **Download** the `.dmg` file from the link above
2. **Double-click** the downloaded file to open the disk image
3. **Open Terminal** (press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal", press Enter)
4. **Copy and paste this command:**

```bash
cp -R "/Volumes/ElastOS 0.1.1-arm64/ElastOS.app" /Applications/ && xattr -cr /Applications/ElastOS.app && open /Applications/ElastOS.app
```

5. **Done!** The app will open. You only need to do this once.

<Callout type="info">
**Why is this needed?** The app isn't signed with an Apple Developer certificate yet. The command copies the app to your Applications folder and removes the macOS security quarantine. Future updates will include proper signing.
</Callout>

## Option 2: Terminal Install

Open your terminal and paste this:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Elacity/pc2.net/main/scripts/start-local.sh | bash
```

Wait for it to finish, then open **http://localhost:4200** in your browser.

<Callout type="info">
Works on **macOS** and **Linux**. Windows users should use a [VPS](/cloud/getting-started/vps) or see the advanced WSL2 instructions below.

## Windows Users

<Callout type="warning">
**Local Windows installation is complex.** We recommend using a VPS instead for the best experience.
</Callout>

### Recommended: Use a VPS

For $5/month, you get a cloud server that:
- Runs 24/7 (even when your PC is off)
- Works from any device (phone, tablet, laptop)
- No complex local setup required

See our [VPS setup guide](/cloud/getting-started/vps) - it takes about 10 minutes.

### Advanced: Local Installation (WSL2)

If you want to run PC2 locally on Windows, you need:

1. **Hardware virtualization enabled in BIOS** (varies by manufacturer)
2. **WSL2 with Ubuntu installed:**
   ```powershell
   wsl --install -d Ubuntu
   ```
3. **Restart your computer**
4. **Open "Ubuntu" from Start menu** and run the install command:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Elacity/pc2.net/main/scripts/start-local.sh | bash
   ```

<Callout type="info">
If you see errors about "Virtual Machine Platform" or "virtualization not enabled", you'll need to enable virtualization in your computer's BIOS settings. This process varies by manufacturer and may not be possible on some corporate laptops.
</Callout>

## Where is everything stored?

| What | Location |
|------|----------|
| PC2 installation | `~/pc2.net/` |
| Your files | `~/pc2.net/pc2-node/data/` |
| Configuration | `~/pc2.net/pc2-node/config/` |

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Command not found: pm2"

Run this first:

```bash
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
```

### PC2 won't start

Check if something else is using port 4200:

```bash
lsof -i :4200
```

If you see a process, kill it:

```bash
kill -9 <the PID number>
```

Then start PC2:

```bash
pm2 start pc2
```

---

## Uninstalling

```bash
pm2 stop pc2
pm2 delete pc2
rm -rf ~/pc2.net
```

<Callout type="warning">
This deletes all your uploaded files! Back up `~/pc2.net/pc2-node/data/` first if needed.
