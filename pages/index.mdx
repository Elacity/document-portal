# Welcome to Elacity

**Elacity is building the World Computer**—billions of personal clouds, interconnected under blockchain governance, trading value through decentralized digital rights.

## Two Products, One Vision

### Personal Cloud (PC2)

Your sovereign cloud that you own and control. Run it on your computer, a VPS, or a Raspberry Pi. 

- Store your files privately
- Run local AI that never phones home
- Package content into sellable Wealth Capsules
- Accessible from anywhere via your custom URL

→ [Set up your Personal Cloud](/cloud)

### Elacity Exchange

The marketplace where Wealth Capsules are discovered, purchased, and traded.

- Tokenized digital rights (dDRM)
- Instant wallet-to-wallet payments
- AI agents as customers
- Programmable revenue splits

## Why This Matters

The internet is broken. You create content, platforms profit. You upload data, AI scrapes it for free. You work, algorithms decide if you get paid.

**We built Elacity backwards** to fix this:

1. **Started with the Exchange**: A marketplace for tokenized digital rights
2. **Realized the problem**: Where would creators actually store and serve content?
3. **Built Personal Cloud**: Sovereign infrastructure anyone can run

The result: **You don't visit servers. You HAVE a server.**

| Old Internet | Elacity |
|--------------|---------|
| Platforms own your data | You own your data |
| You rent access | You sell access |
| AI scrapes for free | AI pays to access |
| Revenue to platforms | Revenue to you |

## The Vision

We believe in **Universal Basic Equity**—ownership of the machines and data that power the economy.

If AI is doing the work, humans must own the infrastructure. Your Personal Cloud is your stake in the World Computer.
