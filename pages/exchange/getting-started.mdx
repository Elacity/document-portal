## Pricing Your Content

| Content Type | Suggested Range | Notes |
|--------------|-----------------|-------|
| Articles/Documents | $1-25 | Per-access or subscription |
| Training Data | $10-1000+ | Depends on size/quality |
| Video Content | $5-100 | Per-view or subscription |
| Code/APIs | $10-500/mo | Subscription recommended |
| Premium Research | $50-500 | One-time or limited access |

## Revenue Distribution

Define how revenue is split:

```
Total Revenue: 100%
├── Creator: 70%
├── Collaborator A: 15%
├── Collaborator B: 10%
└── Platform: 5%
```

All splits are enforced by smart contracts - automatic and trustless.

## Best Practices

### For Maximum Discoverability
- Use clear, descriptive titles
- Add relevant tags
- Write compelling descriptions
- Include preview/samples when possible

### For Revenue
- Price competitively at first
- Offer subscription options
- Create series/collections
- Engage with your audience

## Integration with PC2

Your Personal Cloud (PC2) can serve as the storage backend for your Wealth Capsules:

1. Host your content on your PC2 node
2. Create capsule pointing to your content
3. PC2 handles decryption and delivery
4. Revenue flows to your wallet

This gives you **complete sovereignty** - you host the content, you control access, you receive payment.
