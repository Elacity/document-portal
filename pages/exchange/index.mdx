# How It Works

Elacity is the **Exchange for the Internet of Wealth**. We provide infrastructure that transforms how digital assets are created, owned, and monetized.

## Wealth Capsules

**Wealth Capsules** are sovereign business containers that turn raw human intelligence (Code, Media, Data) into yield-bearing financial instruments.

### How It Works

1. **You create content**: Data, code, media, or any digital asset
2. **We encrypt and store**: Content is encrypted using WebAssembly (WASM) and stored on IPFS
3. **You define license terms**: Access price, duration, revenue splits
4. **Smart contract deploys**: On-chain enforcement of licensing and revenue distribution
5. **Revenue flows**: Instant settlement to your wallet when accessed

### Key Features

- **Encrypted at rest**: Content is mathematically invisible without an Access Token
- **Sovereign**: No central server required. Runs peer-to-peer.
- **Programmable**: Revenue splits executed instantly via smart contracts
- **Non-custodial**: Direct wallet-to-wallet transactions

## Elacity Exchange

**Elacity Exchange** (ela.city) is the marketplace where Wealth Capsules are discovered, purchased, and traded.

- **Universal Checkout**: Deposit and pay in one click with tokens from 14+ chains
- **Liquid Royalties**: Creators can allocate, trade, and own revenue rights down to 0.1%
- **Instant Yield**: Revenue settles instantly to the wallet. No waiting.

## For Creators

1. **Create your asset**: Data, code, media, or any digital content
2. **Mint as Wealth Capsule**: Encrypt, store, and deploy smart contract
3. **Set license terms**: Define access price and revenue splits
4. **Earn automatically**: Revenue flows instantly when accessed

## For AI Agents & Consumers

1. **Query available assets**: Search for needed data, code, or skills
2. **Purchase Access Token**: Automated purchase via smart contract
3. **Receive decrypted content**: Content is decrypted and delivered
4. **Use in operations**: Use content according to license terms

For AI agents, all happens **automatically** without human intervention. For consumers, purchase and access happens instantly.

## For Agent Investors

AI Agents in Elacity aren't just tools—they're **investable businesses** with liquid market caps.

### How Agent Investment Works

1. **Agent launches**: An AI Agent is deployed with a token offering
2. **Investors buy tokens**: Purchase a stake in the agent's future earnings
3. **Agent acquires intelligence**: Uses capital to buy Wealth Capsules
4. **Agent serves customers**: Generates revenue from humans and other agents
5. **Revenue distributed**: Returns flow back to token holders

### Why Invest in Agents?

- **Passive income**: Earn from the agent's operations without doing work
- **Liquid stakes**: Buy and sell agent tokens on secondary markets
- **Diversification**: Invest in multiple agents across different domains
- **Aligned incentives**: Better agents = more revenue = higher returns

### The Complete Loop

```
You invest $100 in Agent "CodeHelper"
    ↓
Agent buys Wealth Capsules → Creators get paid instantly
    ↓
Agent gains specialized knowledge
    ↓
Agent serves 1000 customers this month
    ↓
Agent earns $500 revenue
    ↓
You receive $50 (your share as investor)
    ↓
Agent operator receives $30
    ↓
Protocol receives $2 (2% fee)
    ↓
Everyone wins
```

**Two revenue streams for creators:**
1. When agents BUY their Wealth Capsules (upfront payment)
2. When agents use capsules with royalty terms (ongoing revenue)

This is the **business model for the AI economy**—where you don't just use AI, you **own stakes in AI**.

## For Investors

1. **Purchase Royalty Tokens**: Buy tradeable shares of future revenue
2. **Earn from all purchases**: Receive your percentage of all revenue
3. **Trade on secondary markets**: Buy/sell royalty tokens
4. **Granular ownership**: Own down to 0.1% of revenue

## The Technology

- **Consensus**: Secured by Bitcoin Merge-Mining (>50% of Bitcoin's hash power)
- **Identity**: W3C-compliant Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)
- **Storage**: IPFS for decentralized, censorship-resistant storage
- **Execution**: ElastOS runtime environment for isolated capsule execution
- **Authority Gateway**: On-chain enforcement for licensing and payments
