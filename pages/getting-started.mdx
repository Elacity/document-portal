# Getting Started

Welcome to Elacity. This guide will help you understand the platform and get started.

## What is Elacity?

Elacity is the **Exchange for the Internet of Wealth**. We transform how digital assets are created, owned, and monetized.

### Key Concepts

- **Wealth Capsules**: Sovereign containers that turn your work into yield-bearing assets
- **Programmable Revenue**: Instant, granular revenue distribution via smart contracts
- **Agent-Ready**: Built for the Agentic Economy where AI agents and consumers are customers
- **Sovereign Cloud OS**: Your personal infrastructure node for private computation

## How It Works

### For Creators

1. **Create your content**: Data, code, media, or any digital asset
2. **Mint as Wealth Capsule**: Encrypt, store on IPFS, deploy smart contract
3. **Set license terms**: Define access price and revenue splits
4. **Earn automatically**: Revenue flows instantly when accessed

### For AI Agents & Consumers

1. **Query available assets**: Search for needed data, code, or skills
2. **Purchase Access Token**: Automated purchase via smart contract
3. **Receive decrypted content**: Content is decrypted and delivered
4. **Use in operations**: Use content according to license terms

For AI agents, transactions happen automatically without human intervention. For consumers, purchase and access happen instantly with a single click.

## Wealth Capsules

A **Wealth Capsule** is a sovereign business container that wraps:

- **The Asset**: Your data, code, or media (encrypted)
- **The License**: Access and distribution rights (on-chain)
- **The Business Logic**: Smart contracts for revenue distribution

### Creating a Wealth Capsule

1. **Prepare your content**: Data, code, or media
2. **Encrypt and store**: Content is encrypted using WebAssembly (WASM) and stored on IPFS
3. **Define license terms**: Access price, duration, revenue splits
4. **Deploy smart contract**: On-chain enforcement of licensing and revenue distribution

### Access Tokens

**Access Tokens** grant the right to *use* content. Think of them like a movie ticket or software license.

- Purchased with stablecoins
- Required to decrypt the Wealth Capsule
- Expires based on license terms

### Royalty Tokens

**Royalty Tokens** grant the right to *earn* from content. These are tradeable financial assets.

- Represent a share of future revenue
- Tradeable on secondary markets
- Granular down to 0.1%
- Instant settlement to wallet

## The Agentic Economy

The primary customer of the future is not a human; it is a **Machine (AI Agent)**.

### How It Works

1. **Humans create assets**: Data, code, media, skills (Wealth Capsules)
2. **AI agents and consumers need assets**: To function, learn, and improve
3. **Agents and consumers purchase access**: Via smart contracts, automatically
4. **Revenue flows to humans**: Instant settlement to asset owners

### The Opportunity

- **Scale**: Agents and consumers can purchase from millions of creators
- **Automation**: Transactions happen without human intervention (for agents) or with a single click (for consumers)
- **Efficiency**: No friction, instant settlement
- **Global**: Access to worldwide agent and consumer economy

## Programmable Revenue

Revenue in Elacity is **programmable** and **granular**:

```
Robot buys dataset for $100
├── 70% → Creator ($70)
├── 13% → Investor ($13)
├── 11% → Verifier ($11)
├── 5% → Platform ($5)
└── 0.4% → Fan ($0.40)
```

All executed instantly on-chain. No waiting. No intermediaries.
